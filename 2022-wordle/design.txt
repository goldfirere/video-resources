Problem to tackle:
  - what word to choose next.

At any point in time, there is a # of possible final answers.
We want a guess that will reduce that # by the biggest difference.

(assume an initial state, where we know nothing)
Given a guess G, what information might we get? and how does that information reduce the # of possible answers?

Example:
G = peach
suppose A = beech
information we get = XGXGG
we know A = ?e?ch; no p, no a
maybe another possible answer is merch

To figure out what information we might get, we look at *all* possible answers, and calculate the wordle responses
for each possible response, figure out how many final answers that eliminates
because the number of eliminate answers varies according to what the final answer, we can only get an *expected value*

Computational complexity:
to compute the expected value of a guess G:
  look at all possible answers
  for each answer, figure out how many words are eliminated <-- requires looking at all possible answers
  for each guess G: A^2

total computational complexity is O(G*A^2)
G ~ 10,000
A ~ 2,000

10,000 * 2,000^2 = 40,000,000,000
